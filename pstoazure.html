					<p class="msgdesc">This was intended to be a fully automated upload to Azure, but there were some things that could not be automated,
					Specifically running Sysprep on the VM before it was exported to Azure</p>
				    <p class="msgdesc">The Entire Process can take quite a long time, mainly due to the converting of the VHD file from .vhd to .vhdx, as well as
					uploading the VM to azure.</p>
					<p class="msgdesc">Although this script requests inputs several times during the program, These inputs could be preconfigured to allow full automation.
					The inputs were added to allow flexibility so that others could use the program without modification. Anywhere a needed input could be pulled
					from Azure instead of requested from powershell it was done to minimize requests</p>		
					<p class="msgdesc">This script could serve as a fantastic template for automation in both the uploading of the VM and also the starting of a VM.</p>
					<p class="msgdesc">One of the most challenging things to write in this program was a way to traverse the file system with subscriptions, storage accounts,
					containers, and the objects themselves.</p>
