					<img src="files/centergraph.jpg">
					<br><br>
					<p class="msgdesc">Data came into the Real Estate Center monthly from 48 different areas, and 3 graphs are  needed for Each area.</p>
				    <p class="msgdesc">My script was designed to take the data from a database and import them into the proper fields of an excel spreadsheet.
					The script then created the graphs, and exported them into the proper area of the website in the proper format.</p>
					<p class="msgdesc">Before this was done by hand and usually took several hours to complete, now it takes roughly 4 minutes for the entire 
					program to run.</p>
					
					<p class="msgdesc">The center recently changed how they did the graphs, the current design is done using Highcharts.com based 
					upon the original excel charts.</p>
